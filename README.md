# Milestone-1
I created TicTacToe & the reason for it was because I thought it would be a fun one to create from playing as a kid and then being able to create it as a developer. I used a win/loss/tie functionality. I did a little bit of design with the background image and styled it to look more appealing to the eye. Overall I hope you enjoy my game and find it amusing. Thank You
